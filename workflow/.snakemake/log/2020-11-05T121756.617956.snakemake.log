MissingOutputException in line 86 of /home/kasper/Git_repositories/LiverDB/workflow/Snakefile.py:
Job completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds:
results/Fastq/SRR12845350_1.fq
results/Fastq/SRR12845350_2.fq
This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait.
Terminating processes on user request, this might take some time.
