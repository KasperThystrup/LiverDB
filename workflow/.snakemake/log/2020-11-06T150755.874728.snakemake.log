Finished job 2.
1 of 3 steps (33%) done
Waiting at most 5 seconds for missing files.
MissingOutputException in line 202 of /home/kasper/Git_repositories/LiverDB/workflow/Snakefile.py:
Job completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds:
results/Rawdata/HTSeq_count/transcripts_SRR12845350.tsv
This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait.
Removing output files of failed job count_reads since they might be corrupted:
results/Rawdata/HTSeq_count/genes_SRR12845350.tsv
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
