MissingOutputException in line 231 of /home/kasper/Git_repositories/LiverDB/workflow/Snakefile.py:
Job completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds:
results/Counts/9606_genes.tsv
results/Counts/9606_transcripts.tsv
This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait.
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
